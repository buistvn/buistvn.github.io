This is my personal website for showcasing my projects. It will occasionally be updated to include new projects or features that I would like to add. There is a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflow that is set up to automatically build and deploy the website whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
